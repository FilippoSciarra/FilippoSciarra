Hi, my name is Filippo.

I'm currently a seventeen years old student in a scientific lyceum in Italy, with a lot, and I mean A LOT of interests.
I love biology, zoology, mathematics and music. Did I say that I'm also a semi-professional violinist?
I speak Italian as a native speaker, fluent English (about C1 level) and base-level Hoch German (about B1 Level).

I recently decided to start learning Python as I've always been very curious about coding. I sure hope to learn more programming languages in the future, there's certainly a long road ahead.

I'll be uploading the code that I'm  currently working on, even the dumber ones.
